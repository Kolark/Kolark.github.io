  During my college internship, I worked on a Multiplayer Mobile Escape Room project. My primary role as a Unity Developer was to develop the client-side multiplayer architecture using REST APIs and sockets, as well as to design and implement the game's UI. Disclaimer: Due to an agreement, I am unable to share images of the project at the time of writing this.
