description: >
  Developed by Strange Loop Games, Eco is an online game where players collaborate to build a civilization and advance it technologically to stop a meteor, all while preserving the ecosystem.

  I focused on core gameplay elements, including object occupancies, player interactions, and tools, while debugging and resolving issues in both client-side and server-side code.
