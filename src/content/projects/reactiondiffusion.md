This is an implementation of the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model, as explained in this [article](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/amorphous/GrayScott/).

I first implemented it in Python back in 2021 during a class on mathematical models. However, it was very slow, as simulating smaller images on the cpu could take a couple of minutes. Since then, Iâ€™ve wanted to create a real-time simulation using the gpu, such as this [one](https://pmneila.github.io/jsexp/grayscott/). A couple of years later, I finally built it using three js, and the result can be seen [here](/projects/reactiondiffusion/index.html):

In this simulation, you can experiment with different parameters to observe the patterns that are generated. There is also an additional parameter, which I decided to call "fun", as it can produce interesting results.

You can also change the color palette being used. The palette implementation uses the wave equation parameters to modify each individual RGB channel. It is taken from Inigo Quilez's [article](https://iquilezles.org/articles/palettes/) on procedural palettes.
